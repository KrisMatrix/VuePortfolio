  <h2>Game Development</h2>
  <p>I have been fascinated with video games since I was child.  I
  enjoy playing video games even today...though my ability to play through
  a marathon length video game has certainly diminished!</p>

  <p>I have always wanted to learn video game development, but without adults who were willing to take my interest with some
  seriousness, I stuck to playing them when I was a kid. I had my first opportunity to build a video game in 2021 when I participated in the San Diego Global Game Jam.</p>

  <p>The San Diego Global Game Jam is a bi-annual event where you get to meet
  up with other video game enthusiasts to form a team and collaborate on game design. Everyone focuses on different components, including music, character creation, level
  design, AI, story creation, and more.</p>

  <p>You can check out the game my team created in the Global Game Jam channel
    <a href="https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2021/games/cosmoball-4">here</a>.

  <p> We opted for a classic Super Mario Bros. type style just to get our feet wet. I was primarily responsible for level design, lighting and shadow, and ball movement while my fellow teammates worked on menus, music, character design, level components, and art.</p>
