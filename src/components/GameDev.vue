  <h2>Game Development</h2>
  <p>I have always been fascinated with video games since I was child.  I
  enjoy playing video games even today, although my ability to play through
  a marathon length video game has certainly diminished.</p>

  <p>I have always wanted to learn video game development, but without proper
  mentors who could guide me to study the right subjects for game development,
  and without adults who were willing to take my interest with some
  seriousness, I never got the chance to learn and build a video game until
  2021, when I participated in the San Diego Global Game Jam!!</p>

  <p>The San Diego Global Game jam is a bi-annual event where you get to meet
  up with other game creator enthusiasts to form a team and work one or more
  components of game design. These include music, character creation, level
  design, AI, and game development.</p>

  <p>You can check out the game in the Global Game Jam channel
    <a href="https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2021/games/cosmoball-4">here</a>.

  <p>My fellow team mates did the menus, music, character design, level
    components and art.</p>
